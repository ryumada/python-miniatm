# Python mini ATM
This is the mini ATM program using Python 3.
> Using `Python 3` is important because I use string interpolation which is not supported in the previous Python version

These codes consist of three files:
1. The main program which is `main_atm.py` that will be your executable **run this file into your terminal/console**
2. ATMCard is the ATM card class in `atm_card.py`
3. Customer class that consists of customer identities such as password and current balance in the `customer.py`, an instance is created based on this class
